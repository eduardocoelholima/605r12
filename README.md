### Wait-Notify 1: Provider-Consumer Protocol [1]
- {Drop, Consumer, Producer, ProducerConsumerExample}.java
- Go through code (drawings might help)

- Which class uses the wait/notify mechanism? What for?
- Which code blocks/signatures use the synchronized keyword?
- How is the flag 'empty' being used?

### Wait-Notify 2: Sender-Receiver Synchronization [2]
- {Data, Sender, Receiver, NetworkDriver}.java
- Go through code (drawings might help)
- How related is the send/receive protocol to the producer/consumer one?
- What are the differences?

### Wait-Notify 3
- X.java
- Go over the code
- Only one possible output?

### Wait-Notify 4
- XX.java
- Go over the code
- Only one possible output?

### Wait-Notify 5
- XXX.java
- Go over the code
- Only one possible output?
